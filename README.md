# LotteryPlugin
Not really sure how this is going to work yet, possibly as a 50/50 draw? Players buy tickets with a configurable value that have a number on them and at a configurable time (or after a configurable amount of time has passed) one of the numbers given out is randomly chosen as the winner. Winning ticket can be exchanged for money or other prizes? 50/50 draw assumes the prize is half the value of all the tickets purchased, but the prize should ultimately be configurable as well.

If the tickets are real items rather than just something you keep track of with commands, and if the items each have unique lore, then they won't stack and players won't be able to spam too many tickets. Could be a pro or a con, might want to implement multiple options for how people can implement this plugin on their servers.

Slot machines using maps could probably be a thing too, but that's a bit more complex...
